		GKMManifolds
	Headline
		a package for computations with GKM manifolds and moment graphs
	Description
		Text
			A GKM manifold is a variety $X$, often assumed to be smooth and complete, with an 
			action of an algebraic torus $T$ satisfying the following conditions:
			(i) $X$ is equivariantly formal with respect to the the action of $T$,
			(ii) $X$ has finitely many $T$-fixed points, and (iii) $X$ has finitely
			many one-dimensional $T$-orbits.  The data of the zero and one dimensional
			$T$-orbits of $X$ defines the moment graph of $X$, with which one can carry out
			$T$-equivariant cohomology and $T$-equivariant $K$-theory computations by
			combinatorial means.  This package provides methods for these computations
			in Macaulay2.

	Description
		Text
			If $\{f_x \mid x\in X^T\}$ is a collection of Laurent polynomials in the
			character ring $\mathbb Z[T_0, \ldots, T_n]$ of a @TO TVariety@ $X$, one per each $T$-fixed point, representing an element $C$ of $K_T^0(X^T)$,
			then $C$ is in the image of $K_T^0(X)$ under the injective restriction map $K_T^0(X)\to K_T^0(X^T)$ if and only if
			it satisfies the following "edge compatibility condition":

			For each one-dimensional $T$-orbit-closure in $X$ with boundary points $x$ and $x'$, one has
			$f_x \equiv f_{x'} \mod 1 - T^\lambda_{x,x'}$ where $\lambda_{x,x'}$ is the character of the action of $T$ on the
			one-dimensional orbit.

		Example
			PP3 = tProjectiveSpace 3
			isWellDefined ampleTKClass PP3 --the O(1) class on PP3 is well-defined
			badC = tKClass(PP3, reverse gens PP3.charRing) --reverse the order of Laurent polynomials defining the O(1) class
			isWellDefined badC --no longer well-defined
